# Podcasts in PowerShell

This project contains basic boilerplate for experiencing podcasts through PowerShell.

Both a console and Windows Forms GUI are provided. 

TODO: simplify setup - or make|use|run 'install' script.
However, setup and podcast RSS feed gathering is **only** performed via the console.

Once podcast feeds are specified using **create_update_feeds.ps1** then they may be accessed by executing the GUI or CLI.

VLC (Windows 64 bit version) is used for playing media files. It expects VLC to be located at the 'default' install location, i.e: 
> C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe.

## Getting Started

From the console, run the **setup.ps1** script. This will setup configuration and JSON files for organizing and maintaining podcasts and their episodes. File names and their respective prefixes may be modified within **config.ini** - *HOWEVER* - do so with caution.

Next, run the **create-update-feeds.ps1** script and follow its instructions to add podcasts.

Now you may listen to podcasts by running **main.ps1** or **main_gui.ps1**.

All files created or downloaded are stored in the project folder.
