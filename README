# Podcasts in PowerShell

This project contains simple boilerplate for maintaining and playing podcasts through PowerShell. 

Both a console and Windows Forms GUI are provided. However, setup and podcast feed gathering is **only** performed via the console.

VLC (Windows 64 bit version) is used for playing media files. It expects VLC to be located at the 'default' install location, i.e: 
> C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe.

## Getting Started

From the console, run the **setup.ps1** script. This will setup configuration and JSON files for organizing and maintaining podcasts and their episodes. File names and their respective prefixes may be modified within **config.ini** - *HOWEVER* - do so with caution.

Next, run the **create-update-feeds.ps1** script and follow its instructions to add podcasts.

Now you may listen to podcasts by running **main.ps1** or **main_gui.ps1**.

All files created or downloaded are stored in the project folder.

## Known Issues

The URL provided be an episode may not stream using VLC. In these cases, specify to download and then play. Downloads only occur if a local file is not found.
